                <p>Pest infestations can cause significant damage to your property and pose health risks. At Pemdem Pest Control, we help residents across Eagle Pass Texas  detect the early signs of pest infestations before they spiral out of control.<br>One major indicator is the presence of droppings or shed skin. Whether it’s rodents, cockroaches, or other pests, these remnants are telltale signs that pests have invaded. Another sign to watch for is grease marks or tracks along walls, as rodents tend to travel the same routes, leaving greasy stains behind.<br>Strange noises at night like scratching or scurrying sounds in walls or ceilings often signal a rodent infestation. Similarly, damaged food packaging in your pantry may indicate pests such as insects or rodents have gained access to your food supplies.<br>Don’t overlook property damage, such as chewed wires or holes in wooden structures. Termites, in particular, can silently wreak havoc on your home’s foundation. At Pemdem Pest Control, we specialize in identifying these signs and implementing fast, effective pest control solutions to protect your property.<br>If you notice any of these signs in Eagle Pass Texas contact Pemdem Pest Control today.
