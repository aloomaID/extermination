            <h3>Citrus City, TX Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Citrus City is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hidalgo County, Texas. The population was 3,291 at the 2020 US Census. It is part of the McAllen–Edinburg–Mission Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town was founded in 1943 during World War II by Howard Moffitt, a builder known for his vernacular Moffitt cottage architectural style, as part of a planned regional orange and grapefruit growing community. The local irrigation system proved to be too saline for fruit production, and the plans for a large town were revised. A few Moffitt houses survive in Citrus City.</p>
