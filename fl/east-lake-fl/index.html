                <p>At Pemdem Pest Control, we understand how unsettling it can be to find evidence of pests in your home or business. To help you stay ahead of potential infestations, here are some common signs of pest infestation you should watch for in East Lake Florida .<br>One key indicator is the presence of droppings or fecal matter. Whether from insects or rodents, discovering these traces around your property is a red flag. Additionally, finding chew marks or damage to wiring and furniture suggests rodents are present and actively gnawing their way through your belongings.<br>You may also hear strange sounds in walls, ceilings, or basements, such as scratching or scurrying. These sounds often indicate pests like rats or squirrels are hiding in your property. Nesting materials like shredded paper, fabric, or insulation are another clue of rodent activity.<br>Finally, odd odors such as musty or pungent smells can signal pests have settled in. If you notice any of these signs in your home or business, it’s time to call the professionals.<br>Pemdem Pest Control offers reliable and effective pest control services in East Lake Florida .
