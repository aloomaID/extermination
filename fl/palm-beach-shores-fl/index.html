These sounds often indicate pests like rats or squirrels are hiding in your property. Nesting materials like shredded paper, fabric, or insulation are another clue of rodent activity.<br>Finally, odd odors such as musty or pungent smells can signal pests have settled in. If you notice any of these signs in your home or business, it’s time to call the professionals.<br>Pemdem Pest Control offers reliable and effective pest control services in Palm Beach Shores Florida .
