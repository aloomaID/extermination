                <p>Pests can invade your home or business without warning, and identifying the early signs of pest infestation is crucial to preventing damage and health risks. At Pemdem Pest Control, we help residents and businesses across Elm City North Carolina  spot these warning signs and take swift action to safeguard their properties.<br>One common indicator of a pest problem is the appearance of droppings. Whether it’s rodents, cockroaches, or other insects, pest droppings are a clear sign that you have unwanted visitors. You may also notice gnaw marks on wires, furniture, or walls, especially if rodents are involved.<br>Another red flag is unexplained noises. Scratching, scurrying, or squeaking sounds in your walls or ceilings can indicate pests hiding in hard-to-reach areas. Similarly, unpleasant odors could be a sign of a pest infestation. Rodents, for example, often leave behind a strong, musty smell.<br>If you spot nests or hive formations, especially in basements or attics, it’s time to call a professional pest control service. Additionally, physical damage to plants, wood, or fabric can suggest termites or other wood-boring pests are present.<br>At Pemdem Pest Control, we offer comprehensive pest control solutions for residents and businesses in Elm City North Carolina .
