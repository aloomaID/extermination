At Pemdem Pest Control, we help residents and businesses across West Jefferson North Carolina  spot these warning signs and take swift action to safeguard their properties.<br>One common indicator of a pest problem is the appearance of droppings.

Rodents, for example, often leave behind a strong, musty smell.<br>If you spot nests or hive formations, especially in basements or attics, it’s time to call a professional pest control service. Additionally, physical damage to plants, wood, or fabric can suggest termites or other wood-boring pests are present.<br>At Pemdem Pest Control, we offer comprehensive pest control solutions for residents and businesses in West Jefferson North Carolina .

            <h3>West Jefferson, NC Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>West Jefferson was incorporated in 1909. At one time, West Jefferson had the distinction of having the only cheese factory in the southeastern United States. For many decades, West Jefferson was served by the Norfolk and Western Railroad, better known as the 'Virginia Creeper'. The railroad was the primary reason for the creation of West Jefferson, as the town became a major stop on the railway. With the decline of the railroad and the loss of textile factory jobs to foreign markets, West Jefferson's economy is increasingly devoted to the tourism industry. The town's location in the Appalachian Mountains has led to many tourists visiting the area each year, and many out-of-state tourists have begun to build cabins and housing developments around the town. Attractions include a walkable main street with food, breweries, local art, a cheese factory, a vintage theater, an annual festival, a caboose from a train, and a children's playground.</p>
