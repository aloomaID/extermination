At Pemdem Pest Control, we help residents and businesses across East Orange New Jersey  spot these warning signs and take swift action to safeguard their properties.<br>One common indicator of a pest problem is the appearance of droppings.

You may also notice gnaw marks on wires, furniture, or walls, especially if rodents are involved.<br>Another red flag is unexplained noises. Scratching, scurrying, or squeaking sounds in your walls or ceilings can indicate pests hiding in hard-to-reach areas. Similarly, unpleasant odors could be a sign of a pest infestation. Rodents, for example, often leave behind a strong, musty smell.<br>If you spot nests or hive formations, especially in basements or attics, it’s time to call a professional pest control service. Additionally, physical damage to plants, wood, or fabric can suggest termites or other wood-boring pests are present.<br>At Pemdem Pest Control, we offer comprehensive pest control solutions for residents and businesses in East Orange New Jersey .
