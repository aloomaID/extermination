            <h3>Burton, MI Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Although there were Native Americans and trappers whom lived on land earlier, and even some who attempted to settle by there, many of the original settlers of Burton came from the towns of Adams and Henderson in Jefferson County, New York. For 20 years, this area was known as the Atherton settlement, after brothers Shubael and Perus Atherton and nephew Pliny Atherton Skinner (and later joined by another brother, Adonijah), who settled on the Thread Creek in 1835. Atherton descendants still live in Burton in 2014.</p>
