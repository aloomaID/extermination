                <p>Pests can invade your home or business without warning, and identifying the early signs of pest infestation is crucial to preventing damage and health risks. At Pemdem Pest Control, we help residents and businesses across Union South Carolina  spot these warning signs and take swift action to safeguard their properties.<br>One common indicator of a pest problem is the appearance of droppings. Whether it’s rodents, cockroaches, or other insects, pest droppings are a clear sign that you have unwanted visitors. You may also notice gnaw marks on wires, furniture, or walls, especially if rodents are involved.<br>Another red flag is unexplained noises. Scratching, scurrying, or squeaking sounds in your walls or ceilings can indicate pests hiding in hard-to-reach areas. Similarly, unpleasant odors could be a sign of a pest infestation. Rodents, for example, often leave behind a strong, musty smell.<br>If you spot nests or hive formations, especially in basements or attics, it’s time to call a professional pest control service. Additionally, physical damage to plants, wood, or fabric can suggest termites or other wood-boring pests are present.<br>At Pemdem Pest Control, we offer comprehensive pest control solutions for residents and businesses in Union South Carolina .

            <h3>Union, SC Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Both the city of Union and Union County received their names from the old Union Church that stood a short distance from the Monarch Mill. When it was first founded, the city of Union was known as Unionville; later the name was shortened to Union. The county's first white settlers came from Virginia in 1749. Union County's population grew the fastest between 1762 and the start of the Revolutionary War. Settlers built log cabins and cultivated tobacco, flax, corn and wheat. Union was one of the first towns settled in the area and was untouched during the Civil War because the Broad River flooded and turned Sherman’s troops away from the town.</p>
