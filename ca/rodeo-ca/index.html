These are often created by pests like mice or insects entering your property. Nocturnal noises like scratching or squeaking coming from your attic, walls, or basement are also strong indicators that pests are present.<br>If you detect unusual smells, particularly musty or foul odors, pests may have nested somewhere on your property. These odors can also be the result of pest droppings or dead pests that have gone unnoticed.<br>For expert pest control services in Rodeo California trust Pemdem Pest Control.

            <h3>Rodeo, CA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Rodeo (/roʊˈdeɪ.oʊ/; Spanish for 'Cattle roundup') is a census-designated place (CDP) located in Contra Costa County, California, in the East Bay sub-region of the San Francisco Bay Area, on the eastern shore of San Pablo Bay, 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. The population was 9,653 at the 2020 census. The town is named for the rodeos common in the late 19th century. Cattle from the surrounding hills were regularly driven down through the old town to a loading dock on the shoreline of San Pablo Bay for shipment to slaughterhouses, a practice which continued through the early 20th century. The town of Rodeo is served by the Interstate 80 freeway and State Route 4. The Southern Pacific Railroad main line passes through Rodeo. Rodeo has not been a stop on the railroad since the 1950s.</p>
