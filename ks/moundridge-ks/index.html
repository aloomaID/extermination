Here are some of the most common signs of pest infestation to look out for.<br>One clear sign is the discovery of pest droppings or urine stains. Rodents and insects often leave these behind as they move through your home. Additionally, if you notice chewed wires, wooden structures, or furniture, it’s likely that rodents or termites have made themselves at home.<br>You may also spot unexplained holes in walls, floors, or along baseboards. These are often created by pests like mice or insects entering your property. Nocturnal noises like scratching or squeaking coming from your attic, walls, or basement are also strong indicators that pests are present.<br>If you detect unusual smells, particularly musty or foul odors, pests may have nested somewhere on your property. These odors can also be the result of pest droppings or dead pests that have gone unnoticed.<br>For expert pest control services in Moundridge Kansas trust Pemdem Pest Control.
