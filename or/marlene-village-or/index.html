It is located immediately northwest of Cedar Hills and south of the Sunset Highway (U.S. 26), lying east and west of Murray Blvd. Marlene Village began as a 400-home 'low-cost residential development' on which construction started in early 1949. It was named after Marlene Schnitzer, the then-infant granddaughter of the project's Portland-based developer, Harry Mittleman. The first block of 50 homes went on sale in August 1949. Fire protection and EMS services are provided through Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue.</p>
